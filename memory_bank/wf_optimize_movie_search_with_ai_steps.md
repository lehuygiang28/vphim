# Optimize Movie Search with AI Steps

## Current tasks
- Create AI steps component for movie search
- Integrate AI steps into movies page
- Ensure min 8 second experience (animation)
- Optimize animation performance for streaming effect
- Fix animations to work on individual items, not whole list
- Implement true streaming animation effect (item by item)
- Fix loading state during pagination and filtering
- Fix pagination reset when search or filters change
- Clean up code and remove redundancies

## Plan (simple)
1. Create a reusable AISearchSteps component that shows the steps of AI processing
2. Integrate this component into the MoviePage
3. Implement optimized animations for revealing movie results with a streaming effect
4. Optimize animation performance to prevent lag and stuttering
5. Add animations for each individual movie item rather than the whole list
6. Ensure the animation lasts a minimum of 8 seconds for better UX
7. Improve loading states for all user actions (search, pagination, filtering)
8. Fix pagination to always reset to page 1 when search criteria change
9. Clean up code by removing unused imports and simplifying complex logic

## Steps
1. Create a new component `AISearchSteps.tsx` in the movies page folder
2. Design a component that shows AI working steps with animations
3. Add the component to the MoviePage when AI search is in progress
4. Implement optimized animation system for movie items using framer-motion
5. Fine-tune animation properties for better performance
6. Add batching logic to reveal items in groups
7. Optimize animation performance with requestAnimationFrame and other techniques
8. Fix loading state during pagination and filtering operations
9. Ensure search/filtering resets pagination to page 1
10. Clean up code by removing unused imports and simplifying implementation

## Things done
- Created AISearchSteps component that shows AI processing steps with animated progress
- Integrated AISearchSteps into MoviePage
- Implemented optimized animations for movie results using framer-motion
- Added batching system to reveal movie items in groups for better performance
- Fixed animations to apply to individual items rather than the entire list
- Implemented true item-by-item streaming animation effect
- Optimized animation performance using:
  - Reduced transform properties for better performance
  - Optimized animation timing and easing
  - Used requestAnimationFrame for smoother animation scheduling
  - Implemented ref-based state management to reduce rerenders
  - Added GPU acceleration hints (transform: translateZ(0), willChange, backfaceVisibility)
  - Optimized batch size and timing to reduce CPU usage
  - Memoized rendering functions for movie items and pagination
  - Improved garbage collection and timer management
  - Reduced dependencies in useEffect hooks to prevent unnecessary rerenders
- Improved loading state during page changes and filtering:
  - Added descriptive loading text for different operations
  - Ensured loading spinner is always shown during data loading
  - Made loading state more visible with better styling
  - Added different loading messages for pagination vs. regular loading
- Fixed pagination reset when search or filters change:
  - Updated handleSearch function to explicitly reset to page 1
  - Modified applySearch to ensure consistent pagination behavior
  - Reset animation state when starting a new search
  - Added animation trigger refresh for consistent visual feedback
- Cleaned up code and improved maintainability:
  - Removed unused imports and variables
  - Consolidated useEffect hooks with similar functionality
  - Simplified conditional rendering logic with clear variable names
  - Improved code structure for better readability
  - Removed unnecessary comments that added visual clutter
  - Simplified complex expressions and reduced redundancy
  - Created helper variables to improve readability of render conditions

## Things not done yet
- Final performance testing across different devices and browsers
- Potential further optimizations based on performance testing results
- Consider implementing virtualization for very large result sets
