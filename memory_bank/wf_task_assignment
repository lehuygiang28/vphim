Current tasks from user prompt:
- Simulate task assignment for the VePhim repository using the provided table format.

Plan (simple):
- Analyze the repository structure to identify main projects and responsibilities.
- Map each project/component to the relevant task in the table.
- Assign members as specified.
- Track the status of each task (done/not done yet) for simulation purposes.

Steps:
1. List all main projects: backend (api), frontend (fe), admin dashboard (mnt), mobile (mobile), documentation (documents).
2. Map each project to a task in the table.
3. Assign members to each task as per the prompt.
4. Create a table with columns: No, Task name, Description, Start Date, End Date, Member, Self assessment, Notes.
5. Track which tasks are simulated as done or not done yet.

Things done:
- Analyzed repository structure and identified main projects.
- Mapped projects to tasks and assigned members.

Things not done yet:
- Fill in descriptions, start/end dates, and self-assessment for each task (pending further input or simulation).
- Update workflow as tasks progress or more details are provided.

Additional context:
- The repository contains 4 main projects:
  1. Backend (api): apps/api
  2. Frontend (fe): apps/fe
  3. Admin Dashboard (mnt): apps/mnt
  4. Mobile (mobile): apps/mobile
