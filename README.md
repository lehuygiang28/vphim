## VePhim: Watch Movies Online, Free and Fast

**What is VePhim?**

VePhim is a website where you can watch movies online for free. It's like a giant library of movies that you can access anytime, anywhere with an internet connection. 


**How does it work?**

VePhim doesn't store the movies on its own servers. Instead, it finds movies from other places on the internet and streams them to you. This way, you get to watch a huge variety of movies without any buffering or waiting.

**What's so special about VePhim?**

* **It's free!** You don't need to pay anything to watch movies on VePhim.
* **It's fast!** VePhim uses special technology (HLS) to make sure the movies play smoothly without any interruptions.
* **It's easy to use!** You can easily find the movies you want to watch by browsing through different categories or searching for them.
* **You can save your favorites!** Create a free account to save the movies you love and watch them later.

**What technologies does VePhim use?**

VePhim is built using a combination of powerful technologies:

**Backend (the behind-the-scenes stuff):**
* **NestJS:** This is like the brain of the website, handling things like user accounts, finding movies, and making sure everything runs smoothly.
* **Redis:** This is like a super-fast memory for the website, storing information that is frequently accessed to make the website load faster.
* **MongoDB:** This is like a giant filing cabinet, storing all the information about the movies, users, and everything else related to the website.

**Frontend (what you see and interact with):**
* **Next.js:** This is what makes the website look good and work smoothly on your browser.
* **Ant Design:** This provides all the buttons, menus, and other elements that you see and interact with on the website.

**Mobile App (watch movies on your phone):**
* **Expo:** This allows VePhim to create apps for both Android and iOS phones.
* **React Native Paper:** This makes the mobile app look beautiful and easy to use.
